# The Calculator
This is a readme file. All project should have one. It tells the developers what the project is about, describes the project architecture, technologies used, workflow, etc.

In this case, it's super simple. The goal for this project is to create a calculator.


# Getting Started
No building or deploying anything here, it's as easy as double-clicking the `index.html` file in the root directory to see what it looks like. Then, just open the project folder in your IDE, start making changes, and refresh your web browser to see the changes you made live on the webpage.


# The Basics
Make the calculator function as you would expect a calculator to function. For now, don't worry too much about formatting or styling of the HTML, focus on the JavaScript: is it DRY? Is it clean and concise?


# More to Try
* Try formatting the displayed output to properly display commas (if I recall correctly, this will be more difficult than it sounds).
* Add a div or container next to the calculator to display the user's input history.
    * Whenever the user performs and action (`+-/*=`), add the action to the displayed history.
* Add a nav bar using the already included Bootstrap library.
